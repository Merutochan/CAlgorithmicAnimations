# CAlgorithmicAnimations
A rudimental and experimental C program to generate algorithmic animations.

- Download
- Make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) installed (along with the gcc compiler)
- Edit the main.c file color parameters
- Make run.sh executable with ```chmod +x run.sh```
- Run the sh file as:

```./run.sh TOTAL_FRAMES ```

where TOTAL_FRAMES is the number of frames you want to render, if no number is supplied i will use 240
